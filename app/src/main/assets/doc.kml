following World War I, and even more so after World War II, at least three major powers disposed of massive quantities of captured, damaged, and obsolete chemical warfare (CW) material by dumping 

them in the oceans. According to U.S. Department of Defense reports, the U.S military alone dumped CW agents in waters worldwide on at least 74 occasions between 1918 and 1970.[1,2] The jettisoned 

material consisted either of munitions containing chemicals (such as artillery and mortar shells or bombs) or chemicals encased in some manner in, for example, bulk containers made out of metals or cement. 

Shells and bombs some were jettisoned unfettered, but more often were loaded as cargo into ships that were sunk by opening sea cocks or holed by artillery fire or torpedoes. Sunken ships tended to settle on 

the ocean floor largely intact, with the result that the CW material they contained remained within a small area. Unfettered material could settle within a small area, but also might become widely dispersed by 

currents, tides, and other forces. As can be realized, not much consideration was given at the time to the safety and environmental implications of employing ocean-dumping disposal techniques. </p><p>Some 

dumping operations were carefully undertaken, including the keeping of records of where the dumping occurred, a listing of the material that was dumped, and the quantities of dumped material. Other dumping 

was done haphazardly with no or minimal records being written and kept. In particular, the USSR (and now Russia) has provided hardly any records to the international community of its sizeable chemical 

dumping activities. The potentially enormous problem posed by Soviet ocean-dumped chemical material is demonstrated by Russia having admitted that "at least 160,000 tons of chemical weapons may be 

buried in Russian seas, posing a grave threat to ecology and the health of man."[3] For these reasons, the total quantity of CW material discarded at sea will never be known precisely, but most likely is on the 

order of several hundreds of thousands of tons.[4] To demonstrate the quantities involved, after World War II 302,857 tons of CW ammunitions were left over in just Germany and the United Kingdom, most 

of which were eventually dumped in the oceans.[5] </p><p>As public environmental concerns rose in the 1960s, national and international environmental protection legislation emerged causing the disposal of 

CW agents at sea to become increasingly rare. A major development in this regard occurred in 1969, when the U.S. National Academy of Science recommended that ocean dumping be discontinued as a 

method of chemical agent and munition disposal.[6] However, legal CW ocean dumping did not end until after the "Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter 

1972", a multilateral treaty concluded in 1972, banned the practice of ocean-dumping of CW materials.[7] </p><p>CW agents present three types of threats to the world. First, many contain energetic 

material for explosive dispersion that can self-detonate without warning. Second, by design chemical weapons can cause human casualties, thus some human activities, such as fishing, dredging, and pipe-laying 

in areas laden with dumped CW agents, may result in humans being exposed to chemicals whose powers to burn skin, injure the naso-pharyngeal and gastrointestinal tracts, and close down the nervous system 

are very high (see below). Third, CW agents and their degradation products can cause direct and indirect damage to the environment. There is little data on how and to what extent CW agents may cause 

environmental harm, though it appears likely that CW agents would be able to maim and kill marine organisms in a similar fashion to terrestrial beings. If so, the damage to primary producers in the marine 

environment, as well as the food webs of which they are members, could be very high. </p><p>CW agent disposal sites have created a latent public health hazard with unknown but potentially serious 

environmental consequences. In areas of substantial dumping, such as off the coast of Japan and in the Baltic and Adriatic Seas, a large number of injuries have resulted from exposures to accidentally 

recovered CW agents. In most cases, CW materials are ensnared in fishing nets or accidentally disturbed during dredging operations. For example, Italian scientists have documented 232 instances of mustard

-related injuries, including five deaths, suffered by Italian fishermen in the waters off Molfetta (near Bari) between 1946 and 1997.[8] Bioaccumulation of hazardous levels of arsenical chemicals in the local fish 

population, likely derived from the World War I-era blister agent Lewisite, has also been observed as recently as 2005.[9] </p><p>The Italian experiences in the Adriatic demonstrate that a better 

understanding of the locations of the dumpsites, as well as the status of the materials within them, is needed to gauge the risk posed by undersea CW munitions. Due to decades of advances in ocean science 

and technology, human oceanic activity is increasing and expanding to deeper waters. Consequently, CW dumpsites once thought impossibly remote are becoming increasingly accessible and dangerous to 

unaware explorers and workers. The issue has drawn considerable attention, and concern, by both the public and its elected representatives, resulting in the commissioning of research activities and the 

publication of official reports documenting the extent of dumping activities undertaken in the 20th century and their potential for causing harm. For example, in 2006 the U.S. Congress enacted legislation 

requiring the Secretary of Defense to review historical records and report annually on "the number, size, and probable sites where the Armed Forces disposed of military munitions in coastal waters."[10] 

</p><p>Always keeping in mind that information about most ocean dump sites is incomplete and that many dump sites, especially Russian ones, there is information about an unknown percentage of them; we 

estimate between 40 and 50%. The sites that are best known, and mapped, are those located in the Baltic Sea and North Atlantic, mostly because those who undertook the dumping did record their actions 

and, more recently, these areas have been surveyed for such reasons as natural products exploitation and the laying of cables and pipelines. Chemical dump sites in the rest of the oceans, particularly the Pacific 

Ocean, are hardly known at all, so we think of this project as one that will continue with new information being continually unearthed and periodically used to update the global map. </p></font>
<font color="#663300" face="verdana" size="4"><b><p>Chemical Arms Control and Disposal</p></b></font><font face="verdana" color="#000000" size="3"><p>Major powers, including the US, UK, 

USSR, Germany, and France, manufactured massive quantities of CW agents throughout much of the 20th century. Their widespread use in World War I resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties. The 

horrors of CW use during the war stimulated diplomats to negotiate the 1925 Geneva Protocol, a multilateral treaty banning the use of CW agents in armed conflict. However, the Geneva Protocol has since its 

inception been considered a weak arms control treaty since it has no provisions for verification or levying sanctions. Further, it makes no mention whatever of eliminating chemical weapons. </p><p>In the 

1980s, countries began to draft a stronger chemical arms control convention, which was realized in 1993 as the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of 

Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, more generally known as the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which entered into force in 1997. One of its main provisions requires its State Parties 

(currently 184 with and an additional 4 signatories) to destroy all existing CW stockpiles and renounce any future development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical weapons.[11] Notably, the CWC is 

silent with respect to the remediation of CW agents and munitions dumped at sea prior to 1972. </p><p>With few exceptions, nations that in the past possessed a CW program now belong to the CWC and 

thus are faced with the problem of disposing the remnants of their programs. As this is written, only one CW-possessing country, Albania, has declared complete disposal of its chemical weapons. The major 

possessors, Russia and the United States, are not likely to be in Albania's position until the early 2020s. All chemical weapons and related facilities in current and former possessor countries are located on 

terrestrial sites, hence are relatively easy to access. (Japanese chemical weapons buried in China are the major exception to this statement.) </p><p>The situation regarding marine dump sites is completely 

different. These sites are dealt with in CWC's Article III, which gives State Parties the option of declaring and/or destroying chemical weapons "dumped at sea" before January 1, 1985. Further, State Parties 

are obligated to declare chemical weapons "dumped at sea" on or after January 1, 1985. John Hart notes that as of January 2000, "no formal declaration of dumping of CW in the high seas or in territorial 

waters have been submitted to the OPCW [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapon].[12] As far as we know, no such declaration has been made as of January 2008. </p><p>Nevertheless, the 

countries that in the past chose to take the "easy" way out by disposing their CW material by ocean dumping are now realizing the unpleasant fact that this material, although out of sight, is not out of mind 

because it presents threats to public health and the environment as discussed above. Therefore, countries responsible for past disposals of CW material in the oceans must now consider how they might act to 

undo the damaging actions authorized by past leaders that from hindsight appear foolish. By publishing the maps [13] containing information about chemical dump sites in the ocean, we hope to alert the world 

community about the large scope and seriousness of the problem and make clear that it is indeed global. While it is beyond the scope of our consideration, we note that options for approaches for addressing 

the problem of CW materials resting on ocean floor has been discussed by Hart.[12] </p></font><font color="#663300" face="verdana" size="4"><b><p>Conclusion</p></b></font><font face="verdana" 

color="#000000" size="3"><p>Most of the information present in the open literature regarding the location of CW agent dumpsites in the oceans is specific to a unitary actor (e.g. the U.S. military) or a 

particular geographic region.[14] No comprehensive database encompassing all available marine disposal information has been compiled. Data on casualties due to accidental exposure to chemicals populating 

these dumpsites is even more fragmentary and data on environmental damage is almost entirely lacking. In view of this lack of information, the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies is attempting 

here to make available all-inclusive information regarding the locations of undersea CW dumpsites and the contents they hold in order to facilitate the analysis of public health risks and environmental hazards 

posed by such sites, including the determination of susceptible human populations, coastal industries, and marine ecosystems. Further, a readily accessible database hopefully will serve to call public attention to 

a poorly understood yet significant issue, and also highlight knowledge gaps (such as incomplete or inaccurate geographic coordinate data) that require further study. Because the CWC is virtually silent with 

respect to the issue of undersea CW dumpsites, the opportunity exists for the initiation of a new multilateral effort to address the problem outside the treaty. This project thus seeks to provide a unified, 

nonpartisan data source to stimulate and support the efforts of national and international endeavors to address the serious threats posed to public health and the environment by CW material resting on the 

ocean floor in locations throughout the world. </p></font>

[2] Dumping began in 1945, and continued here until 1976. [1,2,3] Scotland's Ministry of Defense reports that Beaufort's Dyke contains nearly 2 million tons of conventional munitions, 120,000T of mustard and phosgene gas, 25,000T of nerve gas, 330T of arsenic compounds and 1,890T of waste gases. [1]</p><p>Between July to October, 1945, ~14,000T of 5in artillery shells, loaded with phosgene gas were dumped in the trench; between 1945 and 1948, 135,000T of munitions were dumped; between 1949 and the late 1950s, ~20,000T/yr., were dumped; by the early 1970s, ~3000T/yr were being dumped into the trench. While most of these weapons were defused prior to disposal, some remained live. The last recorded dump at Beaufort's dyke took place in 1976, when crews performed an emergency dump of a small number of 40mm (1.58in) shells. [2]</p><p>Of special note, during 'Operation Sandcastle' (1954 to 1956) munitions loaded with tabun were transferred from a secret depot at RAF Llandwrog airbase near Caernarfon, Wales, then placed on merchant ships, which were then scuttled in Beaufort's Dyke and the Irish Sea.

[1]</p><p>(1)  On June 15, 1957, 4,577 1T containers of mustard and 7,380 M55 sarin rockets were encased in concrete vaults and loaded into the SS Corporal Eric G. Gibson. The Gibson was then scuttled as part of Operation CHASE (Cut Holes And Sink 'Em) 8 to a depth of 7,200ft. The wreck site was sampled in 1969. In 1972, it was located, photographed and sampled. No contamination of the surrounding area was detected in any samples. [2]</p><p>(2) On June 19, 1968, 38 1T containers of sarin and VX, 120 drum canisters of arsenic and cyanide were loaded onto the SS Mormactern. The vessel was then sunk as part of Operation CHASE (Cut Holes And Sink 'Em) 11 in 6,390ft of water. In 1969, researchers sampled the site and found no contamination. In 1972 the site was located, photographed and sampled. Again, the sampling revealed no contamination of the surrounding area.</p><p>(3) On August 7, 1968, "miles" off the coast of Atlantic City, New Jersey, two ships loaded with VX rockets were scuttled as part of Operation CHASE 10. The VX rockets were encased in concrete before the ships were scuttled. The reported depth was 6,000ft.</p><p>(4) August 7, 1968, 3,500 1T containers that contained mustard were loaded on to the SS Richardson, along with an unspecified quantity of conventional explosives. The vessel was then scuttled as part of Operation CHASE 12. It was on its descent toward the 7,800ft deep-bottom when a chain-reaction explosion scattered its cargo and destroyed the vessel. Presumably, the explosive reaction was begun by water pressure on one of the weapons, which in turn led to other munitions exploding. [3]. Similar to incident (1), this site was sampled in 1969 and 1972, though debris from the wreck could not be positively identified, no water contamination was found. The 1 ton containers were minimally contaminated with mustard, many of them had stood open at Edgewood Arsenal for over a year prior to disposal.
